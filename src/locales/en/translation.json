    "quiexplication": "<strong>Isaac Newton</strong> is more than just a <strong>scientist</strong> from the past. He's the man who revolutionized the way we understand the world.<br /><br />One day, sitting under an apple tree, an apple falls... and then a question changes everything: <strong>Why does it always fall to the ground?</strong><br /><br />From this simple observation, he discovered universal gravitation, a law that explains the movement of planets, the falling of objects, and even today's space travel.But Newton is also about <strong>light</strong>, color and <strong>movement</strong>... and a legacy that still shapes our modern world.",
