    "quiexplication": "<strong>Isaac Newton</strong> is more than just a <strong>scientist</strong> from the past. He's the man who revolutionized the way we understand the world.<br /><br />One day, sitting under an apple tree, an apple falls... and then a question changes everything: <strong>Why does it always fall to the ground?</strong><br /><br />From this simple observation, he discovered universal gravitation, a law that explains the movement of planets, the falling of objects, and even today's space travel.But Newton is also about <strong>light</strong>, color and <strong>movement</strong>... and a legacy that still shapes our modern world.",

"card3" : "The Newton pendulum refers to Newton's famous seesaw or pendulum, which illustrates the conservation of energy and oscillating motion. Although more popular as a modern teaching aid, it serves as a reminder of the principles of Newtonian mechanics, in particular the laws of motion and the interaction of forces.",
"card2" : "In this painting, Isaac Newton experiments with a prism to explore the nature of light. In 1666, Newton proved that white light is composed of different colors by passing it through a prism. This experiment founded his theory of light and color, marking a turning point in the understanding of optics.",
"card1" : "Isaac Newton also designed a reflecting telescope in 1668, which used mirrors to avoid the chromatic aberrations present in the lens telescopes of the time. This more compact and powerful instrument measured around 15 centimetres in length, with a primary mirror 5 centimetres in diameter. It greatly improved astronomical observation, paving the way for new discoveries in the universe."
